```MafiaBot Patch 1 Notes 10/2/24:
1. Fixed a bug where some commands would succeed but would send the "failed unexpectedly" message (hopefully 100% gone but will be following up in the future)
2. Removed case sensitivity from voting (but now can have lowercase in the vote message which is annoying, a permanent change will come after this mafia ends)
3. Added line to /votecount which says how many votes are needed for majority
4. Bot will now DM the mod when majority is reached
5. Bot now freezes timer once majority is reached, for recordkeeping purposes
6. Added some print statements in db execution to better check for errors
7. Added some custom messages while bot is processing commands```

```MafiaBot Patch 2 Notes 10/4/2024:
1. Added the ability to add or subtract time from the timer without having to reset the whole thing every time
2. Removed some deprecated code I had accidentally been using
3. Fixed a bug where if a vote command failed, it would occasionally not edit the original "sending your vote in..." message and thus never state why it had failed
4. Reduced database calls and merged some database collections, improving bot response times for vote/unvote and setting/unsetting channels
5. Added functionality for multiple log channels, because I can now so why not
6. Added a rolling log of commands the bot prints to console to pinpoint when problems occur
7. Added /togglemajority to continue a day without resetting votes
```

```MafiaBot Patch 3 Notes 10/8/24:
1. Added more case-insensitive functionality, especially for mod commands
2. Some code efficiency improvements, namely with /addplayer and /votecount
3. Added 10-second delay timer for /votecount to prevent spam (not that this has been a problem...yet)
```

```MafiaBot Patch 4 Notes 10/24/24:
1. Massive code reorganization which took forever and made the bot super modular and cool, not that you normies care
2. Complete rework of database access methods, added new database update coroutine which makes commands lightning-fast
4. Added more global lowercase name recognition for ease of use
```

Stuff to add:
1. day functionality, resetting days, adding days, etc, maybe?
2. logging lynches/kills(?) in voting log, maybe?
3. allow mods to create advanced voting rules for specific players - this one's gonna take a bit

```MafiaBot Patch 5 Notes [date]:
1. Added /help commands for players/mods to refer to when using the bot
2. Added /setmod command which allows moderators to choose who gets DM'd when voting ends (without being forced to use /settimer)
3. (As an extension of the above) Removed mod DM functionality from /settimer. Mods must use /setmod for that now
4. Improved bot message clarity, cleaned up log messages
5. Removed some unecessary database calls, some potential command speedups
6. Fixed a bug where using "/toggletimer" would say that the time had stopped but not actually pause the timer
7. Created an internal Timer class to make time-based command programming easier (as the solution to the above) 
8. Some more really cool and awesome code reorganization that will make girls think im sexually attractive and a viable marriage candidate
