1. day functionality, resetting days, adding days, etc
2. logging lynches/kills(?) in voting log
3. remove case sensitivity from voting
4. make playerinfo alphabetical order (why did you not do that before?) DONE


```MafiaBot Patch 1 Notes 10/2/24:
1. Fixed a bug where some commands would succeed but would send the "failed unexpectedly" message (hopefully 100% gone but will be following up in the future)
2. Removed case sensitivity from voting (but now can have lowercase in the vote message which is annoying, a permanent change will come after this mafia ends)
3. Added line to /votecount which says how many votes are needed for majority
4. Bot will now DM the mod when majority is reached
5. Added some print statements in db execution to better check for errors```
