```MafiaBot Patch 1 Notes 10/2/24:
1. Fixed a bug where some commands would succeed but would send the "failed unexpectedly" message (hopefully 100% gone but will be following up in the future)
2. Removed case sensitivity from voting (but now can have lowercase in the vote message which is annoying, a permanent change will come after this mafia ends)
3. Added line to /votecount which says how many votes are needed for majority
4. Bot will now DM the mod when majority is reached
5. Bot now freezes timer once majority is reached, for recordkeeping purposes
6. Added some print statements in db execution to better check for errors
7. Added some custom messages while bot is processing commands```


Stuff to add:
1. day functionality, resetting days, adding days, etc, maybe?
2. logging lynches/kills(?) in voting log, maybe?
3. Add command to set the username of player to receive timer/majority DMs
4. add lowercase version of each person's name in the DB to speed up calls and make case insensitivity much easier
5. allow mods to create advanced voting rules for specific players - this one's gonna take a bit

```MafiaBot Patch 2 Notes [date]:
1. Added the ability to add or subtract time from the timer without having to reset the whole thing every time
2. Removed some deprecated code I had accidentally been using
3. Fixed a bug where if a vote command failed, it would occasionally not edit the original "sending your vote in..." message and thus never state why it had failed
4. Reduced database calls and merged some database collections, improving bot response times for vote/unvote and setting/unsetting channels
5. Added functionality for multiple log channels, because I can now so why not
6. Added a rolling log of commands the bot prints to console to pinpoint when problems occur
```
